# Dictionary_approach_for_text_analysis

This is a data and code repository for the article "Policy Composition and Adoption Duration: Capturing conflict in the legislative process" 
(Chen et al.), to be published in Policy Studies Journal. The article explores the associations between policy composition and the 
relative duration for oil and gas policies to be adopted in 15 U.S. state legislatures.

This data repository demonstrates how to analyze the composition of legislation using dictionaries developed based on Institutional Grammar Tools 
(Crawford & Ostrom, 1995). We quantify and extract key information from bills based on a dictionary of relevant terms pre-identified by the researchers. 
The code demonstrates how to categorize and count terms in bills according to the key elements of Institutional Grammar Tools: types of rules, 
stringency indicators, issue areas, and actors. 

Further details of data sources, coding, and modeling can be found in our paper.
